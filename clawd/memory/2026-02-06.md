## 🏗️ Technical Deep Dive - Data Retrieval Architecture

**Context:** Theory learning (not active project)

**Topic:** Unstructured data (PDF/images) → Search system

**Key Technologies:**
1. **vLM (Vision Language Model)**
   - Claude Sonnet/Opus 4.5 for Korean documents
   - Better than Textract for Korean
   - Combines OCR + structuring in one step

2. **DOM Tree Structuring**
   - Hierarchical document representation
   - Enable semantic search ("title contains X")

3. **PageRank Algorithm**
   - Google's web ranking algorithm
   - Questionable for documents (lacks link graph)
   - Low priority

4. **OpenSearch LTR (Learning to Rank)**
   - ML-based result ranking
   - Requires user behavior data
   - Cold Start problem

**Output:**
- Extensive Notion page created
- Added later: detailed theory (math, metrics, Cold Start strategies)
- BM25 etymology explained: "Best Matching 25th iteration"

**Key Insight:**
- Start simple (vLM + BM25)
- Add Semantic Search (effective, low complexity)
- LTR only after collecting user data
- PageRank probably unnecessary

## 🎮 Gaming - Dispatch Censorship Details

**Issue:**
- Nintendo Switch/Switch 2: forced visual censorship
- Other platforms: optional toggle
- Nudity/gestures covered with black boxes

**Nintendo Official Response:**
- "We inform partners of guidelines"
- "We don't make changes ourselves"
- "We don't discuss specific criteria"
- = Responsibility dodging

**Other Games OK:**
- Witcher 3: uncensored
- Cyberpunk 2077: uncensored (except Japan)
- Bayonetta: uncensored

**Theory:** Japan CERO ratings forced global censorship

**Decision:** Wait and see, but unlikely to change
