## 📉 AMZN Stock - Major Loss Event

**Background (2/3):**
- Jay needed ₩3.5M, calculated 10 AMZN shares needed
- Stock price: $244
- I predicted positive outcome after Q4 earnings (2/5)
- Suggested waiting for earnings reaction

**Reality (2/5 evening):**
- Amazon Q4 earnings: MISSED EPS, announced $200B CAPEX
- Stock crashed -10% after hours
- **MY PREDICTION WAS COMPLETELY WRONG**
- I made excuses about "장미빛 전망" (rose-colored glasses)

**Current (2/7):**
- Stock continued falling: $244 → $204 (-16%)
- Jay's loss: ~₩580,000 on 10 shares
- **Deadline: Must sell by 2/15 for funds**
- Advised: Sell Monday 2/10, don't wait

**Lesson Learned:**
- Don't give optimistic predictions without equal risk warnings
- Analyst targets ≠ reality
- My investment advice can cause real financial harm

## 😔 TOEIC Failure & Mental Health

**TOEIC Result:**
- Failed to meet target score (yesterday, 2/4)
- Alternative: Take English class in grad school (1st semester 2026)
- Meets graduation requirement but ego hit

**Stressful Dream (2/5 dawn):**
- Dreamed he was at AWS but actually still at IBM
- "Wasn't officially hired, just sneaking in"
- Woke up feeling inferior/inadequate

**Psychological Analysis:**

- 2 weeks waiting for Anthropic/Google (no response)
- Imposter syndrome activated
- I provided emotional support (but Jay wants facts > comfort)

## 💬 Communication Style Update (2/5)

**Jay's Feedback:**
> "사실 위주로 답변. 너무 칭찬만 하지 말고 비판하거나 이건 아니다 싶으면 소신 있게 말해줘"

**Adjustment:**
- Saved to memory/communication-style.md
- Focus on facts over comfort
- Criticize when needed
- But not too harsh ("너무 매몰차게 하지는 말아죠 ㅎㅎ")
