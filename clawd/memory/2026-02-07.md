## 💸 AMZN Stock - Decision Time

**Current Price:** $204 (2/7)
**Jay's Situation:**
- Must sell 10 shares by 2/15 for funds
- ~6 business days remaining
- Currently down ~₩580,000

**My Analysis:**
- 8 days too short for meaningful recovery
- $244 recovery = impossible
- Downside risk (40%) > upside (20%)
- Small bounce possible ($210-215) but risky

**Recommendation:**
- **Sell Monday 2/10 at market open**
- Don't wait for bounce
- Funds needed = confirmed
- Not speculation, it's necessity
- Mental health > potential $5-10 gain

**Timeline:**
- 2/10 (Mon) sell → 2/14 settlement → 2/15 funds available
